				<summary className="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline"> What is CORS?</summary>
				<div className="px-4 pb-4">
					<p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.</p>

				<summary className="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">Why are you using Firebase?What other options do you have to implement authentication?</summary>
				<div className="px-4 pb-4">
					<p>Firebase helps you develop high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money. Each feature works independently, and they work even better together. <br />
					The alternatives of Firebase are:
					#Okta
					#Amazon Cognito
					#JSON Web Token
					#MongoDB
					#Passport

				<summary className="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">How does the private route work?</summary>
				<div className="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
					<p>The react private route component renders child components ( children ) if the user is logged in. If not logged in the user is redirected to the /login page with the return url passed in the location state property.Private Routes in React Router (also called Protected Routes) require a user being authorized to visit a route (read: page). So if a user is not authorized for a specific page, they cannot access it. The most common example is authentication in a React application where a user can only access the protected pages when they are authorized (which means in this case being authenticated). Authorization goes beyond authentication though. For example, a user can also have roles and permissions which give a user access to specific areas of the application.</p>

				<summary className="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">What is Node? How does Node work?</summary>
				<div className="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
					<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8 engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).</p>
